 New_York_city_taxi_Trip-Time-Prediction

Project Summary
The NYC taxi trip time prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict the time it takes for a taxi to travel from one location to another in New York City. The model takes into account various factors such as traffic conditions, weather, time of day, and origin-destination pairs to make its predictions.

To build the model, a large dataset of historical taxi trip records is used to train the model. This dataset includes information such as pickup and drop-off locations, time of day, and trip duration. Various machine learning algorithms, such as regression and decision trees, can be applied to the data to build a predictive model.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the trip time for new, unseen taxi trips in NYC. This information can be useful for taxi drivers and passengers, as well as for transportation planning and optimization.

The results of the project can also be used to understand the factors that influence taxi trip times in NYC, such as traffic patterns, weather conditions, and time of day. This information can be used to make improvements to the city's transportation infrastructure and to develop more efficient transportation systems.
